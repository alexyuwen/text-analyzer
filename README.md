# Description
This program prompts the user for the name of a .txt file, then provides summary statistics of the text.  Two files — Tolstoy's "War and Peace" and Shelley's "Frankenstein" — have been included for testing purposes. 

# Usage
To start the program, run the Linux executable using `./cExe`.  Alternatively, you can run `make`, name the executable, then run that.
